# Text-to-Image Generator

## Project Overview
This project utilizes advanced AI techniques, specifically the Stable Diffusion model, to generate images from textual descriptions. It combines cutting-edge transformer architectures and diffusion models to produce high-quality, realistic images based on user inputs.

## Features
- Generate images from custom text prompts.
- Utilize pre-trained models for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
- Adjustable parameters for custom image generation.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - diffusers
  - transformers
  - torch
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - opencv-python (cv2)

You can install the required dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers torch pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required libraries listed above.
3. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment or any Python-supported IDE.

## Usage
1. Load the notebook `TextToImageGenerator.ipynb`.
2. Follow the cell instructions to execute the image generation pipeline.
3. Input your desired text prompts to generate corresponding images.

## Example
